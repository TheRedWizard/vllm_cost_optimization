Started today by refreshing all my ollama models

first i reset ollama since i last used it
rm -rf ~/.ollama

and i removed whatever service was running it.  I now run it with
ollama serve

Which dies on ctrl-c or when i shut the laptop.  (which is what i wanted)

then pulled the following

ollama pull qwen3:8b
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
ollama pull mistral-nemo:latest
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b
ollama pull bge-m3:latest
